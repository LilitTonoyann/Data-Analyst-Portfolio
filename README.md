#  Lilit Tonoyan – Data Analyst & Aspiring Data Scientist

I'm **Lilit Tonoyan**, a detail-oriented Data Analyst with a strong academic foundation in Applied Mathematics and a Master’s in Data Science and Advanced Analytics from Nova IMS. I have experience across e-commerce, logistics, and marketing analytics, with a deep interest in solving complex problems through data. This GitHub portfolio highlights projects I can publicly share to demonstrate my skills and approach to data analysis.

Over the years, I've gotten really good at turning complicated data into clear and actionable recommendations. I'm comfortable working with a variety of tools like **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Looker Studio**, and **Python** to build dashboards, improve data models, and create visualizations that tell a story. I'm always eager to learn new things and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data.

I enjoy both working independently and collaborating with teams, and I'm always doing my best to deliver high-quality data solutions.

> 💡 **Note:** Due to confidentiality agreements, I am unable to share full datasets or detailed workflows from my projects. However, the projects here show my methodology, analytical thinking, and technical capabilities in real-world scenarios.
