# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my public projects in data analytics and data science, highlighting my skills and the progress I've made in these fields.

Hi, I'm Lilit! I'm a data enthusiast with a Master's degree in Data Science and experience across industries like logistics, e-commerce, and marketing. I love digging into data to find those hidden insights that can help businesses make smarter decisions.

Over the years, I've gotten really good at turning complicated data into clear and actionable recommendations. I'm comfortable working with a variety of tools like SQL, Power BI, Looker Studio, and Python to build dashboards, improve data models, and create visualizations that tell a story. I'm always eager to learn new things and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data.

I enjoy both working independently and collaborating with teams, and I'm always striving to deliver high-quality data solutions.
